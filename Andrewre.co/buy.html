										<div class="content">
											<blockquote>"I used Andrew 2 years ago to help me find a house. I’ve used several realtors before him with buying and selling properties and he is hands down the best I’ve worked with. What did it for me was he really understood and listened to what I was looking for and worked around the clock until we found the perfect fit. He was so sharp and had such a deep understanding of the market we decided to use him to sell one of our other properties during the pandemic. He was successful with this deal also. Admirable guy!"</blockquote>

He was there to coach us through everything from negotiating with the sellers, to closing with the attorneys. I would recommend him to anyone who is serious about buying a home because I am confident that he will do as incredible a job for you as he did for us."</blockquote>
